## About
Python implementations of some of the fundamental Machine Learning models and algorithms from scratch.

The purpose of this project is not to produce as optimized and computationally efficient algorithms as possible but rather to present the inner workings of them in a transparent and accessible way.

### Day 1

Ordinary Linear Regression:

Linear Regression is a relatively simple method that is extremely widely-used. It is also a great stepping stone for more sophisticated methods, making it a natural algorithm to study first. A regression analysis is simply a method of estimating the relationship between a dependent variable and a set of independent variables.

Have understood and implemented the Linera regression by using a concept of minimizing the loss and maximizing the likelihood.

### Day 2

Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize some function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent as defined by the negative of the gradient. In machine learning, we use gradient descent to update the parameters of our model.
I have implementated a simple gradient descent to understand the behavior based on different learning rates and momentum
